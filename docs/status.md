## 2. Project Summary

**Project Name:** Simple MP4 Audio Extractor Tool

**Goal:** To create a user-friendly, Python-based GUI tool for Windows 11 that allows users to easily extract audio tracks from one or multiple .mp4 files and save them as .mp3 or .aac files.

**Key Features:**
*   Windows 11 compatibility.
*   Simple Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   Option to select a single .mp4 file or a folder containing .mp4 files.
*   Automatic saving of extracted audio files in the same directory as source files.
*   Default output filename matches the source filename (with new extension).
*   Support for converting multiple files when a folder is selected.
*   Target output formats: .mp3 or .aac (or an alternative if technically simpler using Python).

**Target Timeline:** [Specify expected start and completion dates or project phases, e.g., "Phase 1 (Core Functionality): May 13, 2025 - June 14, 2025"]

## 3. Implementation Progress

**Overall Status:** [e.g., Not Started / Planning / In Development / Testing / Completed]

*   **GUI Framework Setup:**
    *   Status: [Not Started / In Progress (X%) / Completed]
    *   Notes: [e.g., Researching Tkinter/PyQt/etc., Basic window created]

*   **File/Folder Selection Logic:**
    *   Status: [Not Started / In Progress (X%) / Completed]
    *   Notes: [e.g., File dialog implemented, Folder selection implemented, Needs integration with GUI]

*   **Audio Extraction Core Logic:**
    *   Status: [Not Started / In Progress (X%) / Completed]
    *   Notes: [e.g., Researching `ffmpeg` integration via `subprocess` or a Python wrapper, Basic extraction command drafted, Handling specified AAC source format]

*   **Output Format Conversion (.mp3/.aac):**
    *   Status: [Not Started / In Progress (X%) / Completed]
    *   Notes: [e.g., Determined conversion parameters for target format, Needs integration with extraction logic]

*   **File Saving & Naming (Same Dir/Name):**
    *   Status: [Not Started / In Progress (X%) / Completed]
    *   Notes: [e.g., Logic to derive output path/name implemented, Needs error handling for existing files]

*   **Batch Processing (Folder Input):**
    *   Status: [Not Started / In Progress (X%) / Completed]
    *   Notes: [e.g., Iteration logic for files in a folder designed, Needs integration with core extraction/saving]

## 4. Testing Status

**Overall Testing Status:** [e.g., Not Started / Test Plan Drafted / In Progress / Completed]

**Testing Areas Covered So Far:**
*   [e.g., Manual testing of single file selection]
*   [e.g., Basic extraction test with a known good MP4 file]
*   [e.g., Error handling for non-MP4 files]

**Outstanding Issues Found During Testing:**
*   [List any bugs or issues identified, e.g., Tool crashes on files with unusual characters in name, Progress bar doesn't update correctly]

## 5. Risks and Issues

*   **Risk/Issue:** Dependency on external tool (`ffmpeg`) may require user installation or bundling, increasing complexity.
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Requires clear user instructions or larger distribution size)
    *   **Status:** Open
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Decide on distribution strategy (require user install, bundle `ffmpeg.exe`, use a wrapper that manages dependency) and document clearly.

*   **Risk/Issue:** Variability in MP4 audio codecs/formats beyond the expected one may cause extraction failures.
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Limits tool's usability for some files)
    *   **Status:** Open
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Implement robust error handling, log extraction failures, potentially add future support for more formats, or clearly document limitations.

*   **Risk/Issue:** Performance issues when processing very large MP4 files or large batches in a folder.
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Poor user experience)
    *   **Status:** Open
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Implement basic progress indicators (e.g., status label), ensure sequential processing by default, investigate potential for simple threading if necessary and feasible within the GUI framework.

*   **Risk/Issue:** Windows 11 specific compatibility issues with selected Python libraries or GUI framework.
    *   **Impact:** High (Tool may not work as intended on target OS)
    *   **Status:** Open
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Conduct regular testing specifically on a Windows 11 environment throughout development.
