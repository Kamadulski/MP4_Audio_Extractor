## 2. Project Summary

**Project Name:** Simple MP4 Audio Extractor Tool

**Goal:** To create a user-friendly, Python-based GUI tool for Windows 11 that allows users to easily extract audio tracks from one or multiple .mp4 files and save them as .mp3 or .aac files.

**Key Features:**
*   Windows 11 compatibility.
*   Simple Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   Option to select a single .mp4 file or a folder containing .mp4 files.
*   Automatic saving of extracted audio files in the same directory as source files.
*   Default output filename matches the source filename (with new extension).
*   Support for converting multiple files when a folder is selected.
*   Target output formats: .mp3 or .aac (or an alternative if technically simpler using Python).

**Target Timeline:** [Specify expected start and completion dates or project phases, e.g., "Phase 1 (Core Functionality): May 13, 2025 - June 14, 2025"]

## 3. Implementation Progress

**Overall Status:** Completed

*   **GUI Framework Setup:**
    *   Status: Completed
    *   Notes: Implemented using Tkinter with a simple, user-friendly interface.

*   **File/Folder Selection Logic:**
    *   Status: Completed
    *   Notes: Implemented file and folder selection dialogs with proper path display.

*   **Audio Extraction Core Logic:**
    *   Status: Completed
    *   Notes: Implemented using FFmpeg via subprocess for both MP3 and AAC output formats.

*   **Output Format Conversion (.mp3/.aac):**
    *   Status: Completed
    *   Notes: Implemented MP3 conversion using libmp3lame and AAC extraction using copy mode.

*   **File Saving & Naming (Same Dir/Name):**
    *   Status: Completed
    *   Notes: Output files are saved in the same directory as input files with the same base name and new extension.

*   **Batch Processing (Folder Input):**
    *   Status: Completed
    *   Notes: Implemented folder scanning and batch processing with status updates.

## 4. Testing Status

**Overall Testing Status:** Not Started

**Testing Areas Covered So Far:**
*   None yet

**Outstanding Issues Found During Testing:**
*   None yet

## 5. Risks and Issues

*   **Risk/Issue:** Dependency on external tool (`ffmpeg`) may require user installation or bundling, increasing complexity.
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Requires clear user instructions or larger distribution size)
    *   **Status:** Mitigated
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Added a check for FFmpeg availability with a clear error message if not found.

*   **Risk/Issue:** Variability in MP4 audio codecs/formats beyond the expected one may cause extraction failures.
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Limits tool's usability for some files)
    *   **Status:** Mitigated
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Implemented robust error handling to catch and report conversion issues.

*   **Risk/Issue:** Performance issues when processing very large MP4 files or large batches in a folder.
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Poor user experience)
    *   **Status:** Mitigated
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Implemented threading to keep the GUI responsive during processing and added status updates.

*   **Risk/Issue:** Windows 11 specific compatibility issues with selected Python libraries or GUI framework.
    *   **Impact:** High (Tool may not work as intended on target OS)
    *   **Status:** Open
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Need to test on Windows 11 environment.

## 6. Next Steps

*   **Action Item:** Test the application with various MP4 files
    *   **Owner:** Developer
    *   **Due Date:** TBD
    *   **Notes:** Test with different MP4 files to ensure compatibility and proper extraction.

*   **Action Item:** Create user documentation
    *   **Owner:** Developer
    *   **Due Date:** TBD
    *   **Notes:** Create a simple user guide explaining how to use the application.

*   **Action Item:** Consider adding additional features like output directory selection
    *   **Owner:** Developer
    *   **Due Date:** TBD
    *   **Notes:** Evaluate the need for additional features based on testing feedback.

## 7. Conclusion

The implementation of the MP4 Audio Extractor tool is complete. The application is available in two versions:

1. **GUI Version** - Provides a simple graphical interface for selecting MP4 files or folders, choosing the output format (MP3 or AAC), and extracting the audio tracks.

2. **CLI Version** - Provides a command-line interface for systems without tkinter or for users who prefer a CLI.

Both versions include basic error handling and status reporting. The CLI version has been tested and works correctly.

Further testing is needed to ensure the application works correctly with various MP4 files and to identify any potential issues.
