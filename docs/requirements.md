*(Included above)*

## 2. Project Overview

**Purpose:** The primary purpose of this project is to develop a straightforward desktop utility that simplifies the process of extracting audio tracks from MP4 video files. This tool addresses the common need to obtain the audio content of a video without requiring complex video editing software or command-line tools.

**Goals:**
*   Provide a user-friendly graphical interface for selecting source MP4 files or folders.
*   Enable batch processing for converting multiple MP4 files in a selected folder.
*   Automatically save the extracted audio files in a standard audio format (MP3 or AAC) in a predictable location with intuitive naming.
*   Ensure compatibility and reliable operation on the Windows 11 operating system using the Python programming language.

**Target Users:** This tool is intended for individuals who require a simple, efficient way to extract audio from their MP4 video files for personal use. This includes users who may want to create audio-only versions of music videos, lectures, podcasts embedded in videos, or other video content.

## 3. Functional Requirements (FR)

This section details the core features required for the tool.

**FR-1: File and Folder Selection**
*   **Description:** The user must be able to select either a single .mp4 file or a folder containing multiple .mp4 files as input for the conversion process via the graphical user interface.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The GUI shall include a button or option to "Select File".
    *   Clicking "Select File" shall open a standard Windows file picker dialog, initially filtered to show `.mp4` files.
    *   The GUI shall include a button or option to "Select Folder".
    *   Clicking "Select Folder" shall open a standard Windows folder picker dialog.
    *   The path of the selected file or folder shall be displayed clearly in the GUI.

**FR-2: Audio Extraction and Conversion**
*   **Description:** The tool must extract the audio track from the selected MP4 file(s) and convert it into a standard audio format (.mp3 or .aac).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Upon initiating the conversion (e.g., via a "Start Conversion" button), the tool shall process the selected input(s).
    *   For a single selected file, one output audio file shall be generated.
    *   For a selected folder, the tool shall identify all `.mp4` files within that folder (excluding subfolders) and attempt to convert each. An output audio file shall be generated for every successfully processed `.mp4` file.
    *   The output audio file format shall be either .mp3 or .aac, based on the chosen implementation efficiency.
    *   The tool must successfully handle the expected input audio format (AAC 48000Hz stereo 320kbps) as described.
    *   Basic progress or status (e.g., "Processing file X of Y", "Done") shall be displayed in the GUI.

**FR-3: Output Location and Naming**
*   **Description:** The tool must save the generated audio file(s) in a predictable location with a logical naming convention based on the source file(s).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   By default, output audio files shall be saved in the *same directory* as their corresponding source .mp4 file.
    *   The output filename shall be the same as the source filename, with the `.mp4` extension replaced by the chosen output extension (.mp3 or .aac). For example, `video.mp4` in `C:\Videos` should result in `C:\Videos\video.mp3` (or `.aac`).
    *   If an output file with the target name already exists, the tool's default behavior should be clearly defined (e.g., overwrite, skip, or add a numerical suffix like `filename(1).mp3`). *Recommendation: Default to overwrite for simplicity, or prompt/skip if feasible within constraints.*

**FR-4: Simple GUI**
*   **Description:** The tool must present a user-friendly graphical interface that is easy to understand and operate.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The GUI shall display input controls (buttons/fields) for selecting file or folder.
    *   The selected input path shall be clearly visible.
    *   A prominent button to initiate the conversion process shall be present.
    *   The layout should be intuitive and uncluttered.

**FR-5: Basic Error Handling**
*   **Description:** The tool should provide basic feedback to the user in case of errors or issues during selection or conversion.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   If a non-MP4 file is selected via the file picker (though the filter helps, explicit handling is good), the tool should inform the user.
    *   If a folder is selected that contains no .mp4 files, the tool should inform the user after scanning.
    *   If an error occurs during the extraction/conversion of a specific file in a batch, the tool should ideally log or report the error without necessarily stopping the entire batch process (if possible within complexity constraints). A general "An error occurred" message box is acceptable for minimum scope.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

This section outlines the non-functional aspects required for the tool.

**NFR-1: Performance**
*   **Description:** The tool should perform the conversion process efficiently.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Conversion time for a typical MP4 file (e.g., 30 minutes) should be completed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within a few minutes) on a standard Windows 11 machine.
    *   Processing a batch of files in a folder should be reasonably efficient, utilizing available system resources without causing the system to become unresponsive.

**NFR-2: Security**
*   **Description:** The tool should not introduce security vulnerabilities or misuse user data.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The tool shall not require administrative privileges to run, only standard user permissions sufficient to read source files and write output files in user-accessible locations.
    *   The tool shall not transmit any user data or file information over a network connection.
    *   The tool shall not modify any system settings or install unexpected software.

**NFR-3: Technical Requirements**
*   **Description:** The tool must adhere to specified technical constraints and environments.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The tool must be developed primarily using the Python programming language.
    *   The tool must be deployable and executable on a standard installation of Windows 11.
    *   The tool should rely on standard Python libraries or widely used, easily installable third-party libraries.

## 5. Dependencies and Constraints

**Dependencies:**
*   **Operating System:** Windows 11.
*   **Software Environment:** A functional Python installation (version 3.6 or later recommended).
*   **Required Libraries:**
    *   A Python library for creating GUIs (e.g., Tkinter - standard, PyQt, or Kivy).
    *   An external library or Python wrapper capable of reading MP4 container formats, extracting audio streams, and encoding/converting audio to MP3 or AAC format (e.g., `ffmpeg` executable accessible via `subprocess`, or a Python wrapper like `moviepy`, `pydub` potentially combined with backend tools).

**Constraints:**
*   **Tech Stack:** Development must primarily utilize Python.
*   **Platform:** The tool is required to function specifically on Windows 11. Cross-platform compatibility is not a requirement for this version.
*   **GUI Complexity:** The GUI should remain simple and focused on the core task (select input, start conversion, show status). Advanced options are out of scope for the minimum viable product.
*   **Audio Format Handling:** While the tool *ideally* would handle various MP4 audio codecs, the minimum requirement focuses on correctly processing the specified `AAC 48000Hz stereo 320kbps` format. Handling other formats found within MP4s may be considered enhancements.
*   **Output Format Flexibility:** The tool targets *either* .mp3 or .aac output. There is no requirement for the user to choose the output format; the implementation should pick one based on ease of development or reliability with the chosen libraries.

## 6. Risk Assessment

**Risk 1: Difficulty integrating/packaging audio processing library (e.g., ffmpeg)**
*   **Description:** Distributing or integrating external command-line tools like ffmpeg or complex Python wrappers can be challenging, especially ensuring they work reliably on all Windows 11 setups without requiring users to install separate software.
*   **Mitigation:** Use a well-documented Python library that handles the external tool dependency gracefully (e.g., automatically downloads/includes it) or select a library that is purely Python-based if a suitable one exists with necessary capabilities (less likely for robust encoding). Thorough testing on different Windows 11 environments. Clearly document any necessary prerequisites for the user.

**Risk 2: Handling diverse MP4 codecs/formats**
*   **Description:** Although the requirement specifies an *expected* input format, MP4 containers can hold various audio codecs. The chosen library might not support all of them, or extraction/conversion might fail unexpectedly for certain files.
*   **Mitigation:** Research library capabilities thoroughly during the technical design phase. Implement robust error handling for individual file conversions in batch mode. Document the specific formats known to be supported. Future versions could include broader codec support.

**Risk 3: Performance bottlenecks with large files or batches**
*   **Description:** Converting many files or very large files can be resource-intensive, potentially leading to long processing times or the application appearing frozen.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement asynchronous processing or threading for file conversions so the GUI remains responsive. Include a progress indicator. Optimize library usage for performance where possible. Manage user expectations through clear status updates.

**Risk 4: GUI library compatibility/packaging issues**
*   **Description:** Choosing and packaging a Python GUI library (especially non-standard ones like PyQt) can add complexity to distribution (e.g., creating an executable).
*   **Mitigation:** Prioritize using standard libraries like Tkinter if its capabilities are sufficient for the simple GUI. If not, choose a widely supported library and utilize robust packaging tools (like PyInstaller) and test the packaged application thoroughly on a clean Windows 11 environment.

**Risk 5: User expectation mismatch**
*   **Description:** Users might expect features beyond the minimum requirements (e.g., bitrate control, output folder selection, editing metadata, converting non-MP4 files).
*   **Mitigation:** Clearly define the scope and limitations of this version of the tool in any user-facing documentation or within the GUI itself (e.g., a simple "About" box). Gather feedback for potential future enhancements. Ensure the basic functionality is extremely reliable to meet the core need.
